// For the simplicity of testing and verifying the code 
//backend and frontend are merged inside a same zip, 
//these 2 compartments will be separated in order to deploy on host

//to start the application, call the integrated terminal and enter
//npm i
//to initialize the application

//after that, kill the terminal (just to make sure) and call up 2 more terminals
//enter npm run dev on the 1st terminal to run backend server
//and npm start on the 2nd terminal to run frontend application

//if 2nd terminal result in "compiled with warning"
//do not worry, the application is still able to run normally
//but if you do want to see the compile success notification
//kill the 2nd terminal and call another terminal, then npm start
//the application should be able to compile on the 2nd try
